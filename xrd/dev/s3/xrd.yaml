  # Each type of XR can declare any keys they write to their connection secret
  # which will act as a filter during aggregation of the connection secret from
  # composed resources. It's recommended to provide the set of keys here so that
  # consumers of claims and XRs can see what to expect in the connection secret.
  # If no key is given, then all keys in the aggregated connection secret will
  # be written to the connection secret of the XR.
